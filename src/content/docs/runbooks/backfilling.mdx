This page goes in detail about performing backfills for the NBA ELT Project

## Data Sources

There are 3 separate entities that involve varying degrees of backfilling

### Ingestion Script

The Boxscore + Play-by-Play (PBP) data is sometimes not refreshed in time when the Ingestion Script is triggered at 12 pm UTC every day. When this happens, the script will complete successfully and send an alert to Slack that the data was not available

- <Image
    src={slack_alert}
    alt="slack"
    loading="lazy"
    decoding="async"
    class="w-full h-auto"
  />

Later in the day, a backfill for the missing data can be run by executing the following command:

```sh
python -m scripts.backfill --run_date 2025-01-01
```

- This is a Backfill Script which takes in a required `run_date` argument in the format of `YYYY-MM-DD`. It executes the Boxscores + PBP data portion of the Ingestion Script for that run date, and stores the results to Postgres.
- For example, if you choose a run date of `2025-01-01`, it will pull Boxscore data from games played on `2025-01-01`, and also pull PBP data for those same games.

After ingesting the data into the `bronze` schema, you may want to manually trigger a dbt refresh to ensure downstream services are immediately serving the latest data.

> _Note: This step is optional—if you choose not to refresh dbt manually, the data will be automatically updated during the next scheduled run of the dbt job._

### dbt

For backfill purposes, to refresh specific models and their downstream dependencies in the dbt project you can run commands like:

- `dbt build --select fact_boxscores+ fact_pbp_data+ --target prod`
  - This is typically what must be ran after an Ingestion Script backfill
- `dbt build --select fact_schedule_data+ --target prod --full-refresh`
- Adjust this depending on what you want to refresh

If needed, the entire dbt project can be refreshed with:

- `dbt build --target prod --full-refresh`
- As of March 2025, a full refresh on the entire project takes about ~4 minutes to run

> _Note: Running a full refresh has no downsides. All models can be rebuilt at any time, ensuring consistent accuracy._

### ML Pipeline

The ML Pipeline pulls data from `silver.ml_tonights_games` to generate predictions for upcoming games that night. If there was an issue upstream in the NBA ELT Pipeline that affects this table being refreshed properly, then the ML Pipeline will likely fail and not generate predictions for that day.

After addressing the upstream issue and refreshing this table via dbt, you can run the ML Pipeline with the following command:

- `python -m src.app` runs the Pipeline as a module and will pulls the data, generates the predictions, and uploads them back to Postgres to the `gold.ml_game_predictions` table

Afterwards, you can verify the data by running the following query:

```sql
select *
from gold.ml_game_predictions
order by game_date desc
limit 100;
```

## Rebooting Downstream Services

The REST API is a stateless service and does not need to be rebooted; it will always pull the latest data available in the `mart` Layer on every request.

However, if you've refreshed the data in the `mart` Layer and want those changes to be reflected in the Dashboard, then run the following script to reboot the ECS Service which will force it to re-pull the data.

- This typically results in a 5-10 second downtime for the dashboard, but it will automatically re-sync and be back up shortly after

```sh
#!/bin/bash

ECS_CLUSTER="jacobs-ecs-ec2-cluster"
ECS_SERVICE="nba_elt_dashboard"
REGION="us-east-1"

# List tasks
task_list=$(aws ecs list-tasks --cluster $ECS_CLUSTER --service-name $ECS_SERVICE --region $REGION)

# Get first task
first_task=$(echo "$task_list" | jq -r '.taskArns[0]')

# Stop the first task
aws ecs stop-task --cluster $ECS_CLUSTER --task $first_task --region $REGION

```
