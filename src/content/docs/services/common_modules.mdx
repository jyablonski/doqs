jyablonski Common Modules is an internal Python library hosted on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/jyablonski_common_modules/) that is used throughout various services & applications in the project

---

## How It Works

The library provides a collection of helper and utility functions that can be reused across scripts and services throughout the project.

It can be installed as a Python package in any environment using the following command:

```sh
pip install jyablonski-common-modules
```

The library currently includes functions for SQL-related connections and upsert operations, general Python logging, and AWS utilities. I plan to expand its functionality and scope as needed in the future.

## Code Layout

The project is broken down like below:

<FileTree>

- jyablonski_common_modules
  - aws/
  - general/
  - logging/
  - sql/
- tests
  - confest.py
  - unit/
  - integration/

</FileTree>

This source code structure allows for clean and concise import statements, such as:

```py
from jyablonski_common_modules.logging import create_logger
from jyablonski_common_modules.sql import create_sql_engine, write_to_sql_upsert
```

To enable importing any function from subdirectories like `sql` or `logging`, the `__init__.py` for each subdirectory is configured like so:

```py
from .connection import create_sql_engine
from .writers import write_to_sql_upsert


__all__ = ["create_sql_engine", "write_to_sql_upsert"]
```

## CI / CD

For continuous integration (CI), the entire test suite is run on every commit in a pull request using Docker.

After a PR is merged, the continuous deployment (CD) pipeline performs the following steps:

1. Builds the library and generates platform-specific wheels
2. Publishes the new version and wheels to PyPI
