Doqs is an internal site written in Starlight to store documentation on the NBA ELT Project

## Architecture

``` mermaid

    A[User Facing Traffic] --> B[Amazon CloudFront]
    B --> C[S3 Bucket ]
    C --> B
    B --> A

```

Hover event triggers a prefetch:

Astro/Starlight starts fetching the page data or HTML.
That's why you see the first server log (e.g., /services/dbt/ 13ms) just by hovering.
Click event triggers a full navigation:

After you click, the router proceeds with navigation (or hydration), but since part of the page is preloaded, itâ€™s faster.
The second log you see is the actual page load completing after the click.

## Code Layout

The project follows a structured directory layout to maintain a clean and organized codebase. Below is a breakdown of each directory and its purpose:

### `.github/`
- Contains CI/CD configuration files for continuous integration and deployment processes (e.g., GitHub Actions workflows).

### `docker/`
- Stores all Docker-related files such as `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` used for testing and local development environments.

### `tests/`
- Contains all the test cases for the project. The tests are organized into the following categories:
  - unit/: Contains unit tests for individual functions (e.g., `generate_salt`).
  - integration/: Contains integration tests that involve interactions with external systems (e.g., PostgreSQL, Redis, API endpoints).

### `src/`
- Contains the application code that implements the core functionality of the project. Key files and subdirectories include:
  - dao/: Contains all SQL-related code such as queries, database interactions, and data access objects (DAOs). This is where most of the database logic should reside.
  - server.py: The main server file that initializes and runs the application. It typically contains the application setup and the entry point for the API server.
  - models.py: Defines the SQLAlchemy ORM models for the application, where all the database tables and relationships are specified.
  - security.py: Contains code related to security and JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. This file handles user authentication, authorization, and token generation/validation.
  - routers/: Contains individual files for each API endpoint. Each file should handle a specific route or set of related routes and the logic for processing requests related to that route.
  - middleware/: Includes any middleware components used to process requests before reaching the endpoint logic (e.g., authentication checks, logging, etc.).
  - schemas.py: Defines the schemas for endpoint input and output data (typically using Pydantic or Marshmallow). This is where the structure of request/response payloads is specified.


## Libraries

1. FastAPI is the primary package driving the REST API development
2. Pydantic enables type validation for request and response information in the endpoints

## Production



## CI / CD

For continuous integration (CI), the entire test suite is run on every commit in a pull request using Docker.

After a PR is merged, the continuous deployment (CD) pipeline performs the following steps:

1. The project is built into a set of static HTML, CSS, and JS files in the `dist/` folder
2. The files are then uploaded to an S3 bucket
3. CloudFront reads from that S3 bucket & automatically serves the updated files as soon as the cache expires
